It was such a cold day, and I am sitting at the backseat of my car, typing these words and decided to start my tech blog to share my coding life.

I am glad to see you come to here. Topics of interests shared here inculde Game Development, making vlog, theorecical visualization and music composition.

I want to create content that everyone can enjoy and discuss. I am not an extremely high level programmer, so let's get into it and make progress together!

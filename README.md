I want to create content that everyone can enjoy and discuss. I am not an extremely high level programmer. Let's get into it and make progress together!

This blog site is for recording my coding life. The topics include:
- Game Development.
- Video Blog. 
- Theory Visualization.
- AI Model Application
- Music Coposing.
